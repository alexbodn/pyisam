This package provides a python wrapper around the IBM Informix C-ISAM library or
alternatively the provided vbisam open source library that provides a drop-in
replacement of the C-ISAM library.

The primary reason for this package was to permit a virtual table implementation
to be written for the APSW SQLite wrapper package, without having to resort to
writing an extension module.
