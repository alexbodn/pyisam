This file provides the current things that need to be reviewed, in addition to those that
are marked with TODO or FIXME in the source code.

* Need to review the usage of the ISAMfunc decorator wrapper and the actual ISAM functions
  in order to make those functions that don't return an int by default are actually correct,
  at present there is an implicit keyword of 'restype' which will set the return type,
  however the current usage does not make use of the keyword to implement the correct setting.

+ This is most evident on the isbuild() function which is used to build a new table with a 
  given primary key, and thus, must be tested to check if the result is as expected

* Need to make the indexes more object orientated rather than just a list of tuples, and also
  document the expected usage of the feature.

* Need to overhaul the handling of columns and indexes so that a table can be defined dynamically
  at runtime without first having to provide a table definition through the use of an instance of
  ISAMtableDefn(), this involves reworking how the indexes and columns are defined in order to make
  them as product netural as possible.

+ Need to make use of a metaclass that will instantiate the fields making up a table from a 
  definition that is provided rather than using the namedtuples() way of doing this, unless this
  is impossible/impratical.

* Consider changing the license under which this package should be released.

* Need to write the interface to the APSW Virtual Table support feature

* Add support for the commerical DISAM library in addition to adding support for the open source
  VBISAM library which appears to be a dead project.
