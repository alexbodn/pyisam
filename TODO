This file provides the current things that need to be reviewed, in addition to those that
are marked with TODO or FIXME in the source code.

* Need to review the usage of the ISAMfunc decorator wrapper and the actual ISAM functions
in order to make those functions that don't return an int by default are actually correct,
at present there is an implicit keyword of 'restype' which will set the return type,
however the current usage does not make use of the keyword to implement the correct setting.

This is most evident on the isbuild() function which is used to build a new table with a 
given primary key, and thus, must be tested to check if the result is as expected
